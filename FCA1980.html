      <h2>Forest Conservation Act, 1980</h2>
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        A forest referred to as a wood or the woods, in an area with a high
        density of trees. Forest may vary significantly in size and have
        different classifications according to how and of what the forest is
        composed. Tree forest cover approximately 9.4 per cent of the earth’s
        surface (or 30 per cent of the total land area), though they once
        covered much (about 50 per cent of the total land area). They function
        as habitats for organisms, hydrologic flow modulators and soil
        conservers, constituting one of the most important aspects of the
        biosphere. Thus, viewing their necessity there is need for the
        conservation of forests. “Forests conservation is the exercise of
        planting and sustaining forested areas for the benefit and
        sustainability of future generations. The conservation of forest also
        stands and aims at a quick shift in the composition of trees species and
        age distribution”. Forests are centre to all human life because they
        provide a diverse range of resources and multiple benefits too. Forest
        conservation refers to a range of activities, tools and approaches to
        achieve forest health and biodiversity objectives, including in managed
        forests where harvesting occurs. These activities are set out in
        sustainable forest management plans and many are backed by law (NRCAN,
        2017). Conservation efforts may take the form of provincial guidelines
        that forest companies operating on the land must follow such asretain
        trees used by wildlife during harvesting, create a mix of tree species
        types and age, ensure that sections of forest remain connected to meet
        wildlife habitat needs.When we talk of conserving native forests we
        really mean a deliberate rationing of the cut so that the use of a
        dwindling and non-renewable resource will be spread over a long rather
        than a relatively short period. This type of conservation, important
        though it is, has nothing to do with sustained yield and is not dynamic
        in concept. Likewise the second meaning of conservation reflects a
        philosophy of preservation by locking up is also a static concept.
        Nevertheless, it is entirely valid in two contexts: In the maintenance,
        with as little human interference as is possible, of primitive or
        wilderness areas in some of the larger virgin indigenous State forests.
        In the reservation and maintenance again with the minimum of human
        interference, of forest sanctuaries or strict scientific reserves. These
        are designed to preserve examples of individual species, of forest
        associations, or of particular wildlife habitats; because of their
        scientific and ecological values they constitute an important though
        specialised facet of forest conservation. The most important type of
        forest conservation, however, is the dynamic one; it consists of the
        deliberate and planned manipulation of forest in such a manner that the
        many and varied benefits which forests can confer on mankind are
        maintained unimpaired and are indeed enhanced.
      </p>
      <h3>Initiatives Taken to Save the Forests</h3>
      <p>
        Conservation of forest is a national problem so it must be tackled with
        perfect coordination between forest department and the other
        departments. People’s participation in the conservation of forests is of
        vital importance. So we must get them involved in this national task.
        The cutting of trees in the forests must be stopped at all costs.
        Afforestation or special programmes like Agro-Forestry, Social Forestry,
        Van Mahotsav and other forests related movement such as Chipko Movement
        etc should be launched and implemented on a grand scale. Celebrations of
        all functions, festivals should proceed with tree-plantation. Cutting of
        timber and other forests produce should be restricted. Forests
        Conservation Act 1980 should be strictly implemented to check
        deforestation. The Government proposes to implement the tree plantation
        programme extensively in the country. To increase forest and tree cover
        in the country, the Central Government has initiated several measures.
        Notable among them are launching of National Mission for a Green India
        and taking appropriate measures to put in place a proper institutional
        mechanism for expeditious utilization of amounts realised in lieu of
        forest land diverted for non-forest purpose. The National Mission for a
        Green India: aims at enhancing quality of forest cover and improving
        ecosystem services from 4.9 million hectares of predominantly forest
        lands, including 1.5 million hectares of moderately dense forest cover,
        3 million hectares of open forest cover, 0.4 million hectares of
        degraded grass lands. Eco-restoration/afforestation to increase forest
        cover and eco system services from 1.8 m ha forest/non forest lands,
        including scrub lands, shifting cultivation areas, abandoned mining
        areas, ravine lands, mangroves and sea-buckthorn areas. Enhancing tree
        cover in 0.2 million hectares urban and peri-urban areas (including
        institutional lands). Increasing forest cover and eco-system services
        from Agro-forestry and Social Forestry on 3 million hectares of
        non-forest lands. Agro-Forestry: Agro forestry or agro-silviculture is a
        land use management system in which trees or shrubs are grown around or
        among crops or pastureland. It combines shrubs and trees in agricultural
        and forestry technologies to create more diverse, productive,
        profitable, healthy, ecologically sound, and sustainable land-use
        systems. In other words, agro-forestry is the management and integration
        of trees, crops and/or livestock on the same plot of land and can be an
        integral component of productive agriculture. It may include existing
        native forests and forests established by landholders. It is a flexible
        concept, involving both small and large-sized land holdings. Social
        Forestry: Social forestry is defined as “Forestry outside the
        conventional forests which primarily aim at providing continuous flow of
        goods and services for the benefit of people. This definition implies
        that the production of forest goods for the needs of the local people is
        Social forestry. Thus, social forestry aims at growing forests of the
        choice of the local population. Some biogeographer stated that
        conceptually social forestry deals with poor people to produce goods
        such as fuel, fodder etc. to meet the needs of the local community
        particularly underprivileged section. Van Mahotsav: Van Mahotsav was
        launched in the year 1950 by Shri Kanhaiyalal. M. Munshi, the then Union
        Minister for Agriculture and Food to create an enthusiasm in the popular
        mind for the preservation of forest and planting of trees, as “trees
        mean water, water means bread and bread is life”. It was also hoped that
        it would create tree consciousness among the people.Van Mahotsav, a
        weeklong festival of tree planting is organised every year in the month
        of July usually between 1st July to 7th July all across India and lakh
        of trees are planted. The aim behind Van Mahotsav was to plant trees in
        order to provide fuel and thus release cow dung for use as manure. To
        increase production of fruits and add to the potential food resources of
        the country. To popularise the planting and tending of trees in farms,
        villages, municipal and public lands for their aesthetic, economic and
        protective needs and etc. Chipko Movement:In the 1970s, an organized
        resistance to the destruction of forests spread throughout India and
        came to be known as the Chipko movement. The name of the movement comes
        from the word ’embrace’, as the villagers hugged the trees, and
        prevented the contractors’ from felling them. The original ’Chipko
        movement’ was started around 260 years back in the early part of the
        18th century in Rajasthan by Bishnoi community. A large group of them
        from 84 villages led by a lady called Amrita Devi laid down their lives
        in an effort to protect the trees from being felled on the orders of the
        Maharaja (King) of Jodhpur. After this incident, the maharaja gave a
        strong royal decree preventing the cutting of trees in all Bishnoi
        villages. The Chipko Movement gained momentum under Sunderlal Bahuguna,
        an eco-activist, who spent his whole life persuading and educating the
        villagers, to protest against the destruction of the forests and the
        Himalayan Mountains by the government. The Forest Conservation Act 1980:
        this Act was enacted to help country’s forests. It strictly restricts
        and regulates the de-reservation of forests or use of forests land for
        non-forest purposes without the prior approval of the Central
        government. To this end the Act lays down the prerequisites for the
        diversion of forests land for non-forest purposes. Though in 1977,
        direct reference to forest protection and improvement was made in the
        Constitution through the 42nd Constitutional Amendment Act when Article
        48A was inserted into it, the scholars of forest policies and Acts in
        India would be aware that the framers of the Constitution were already
        committed to environmental protection and its improvement since its
        inception in 1950. There is also a mention in the Constitution about the
        fundamental duty of every citizen ‘to protect and improve the natural
        environment including forests, lakes, rivers and wildlife, and to have
        compassion for living creatures’. [Article 51A (G), 1990]. The Forest
        Conservation Act 1980 will be discussed in detail in the next part of
        this article.
      </p>
      <h3>Forest Conservation Act 1980: An Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        The Forest Conservation Act, 1980 is a Central Act of Parliament with a
        view to provide for the conservation of forest and for matters connected
        there with or ancillary or incidental thereto. The act extends to the
        whole of India except the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Section 2 of the
        act makes a provision of a prior approval of the Central Government
        necessary before a State Government or any other authority issues
        direction for de-reservation of reserved forests (which have been
        reserved under the Indian Forest Act 1927), use of forest land for non –
        forest purpose, assigning forest land by way of lease or otherwise to
        any private person or to any authority, corporation, agency or any other
        organization not owned, managed or controlled by the government and
        clear felling of naturally grown trees. The term “forest land” mentioned
        in Section 2 of the Act refers to reserved forest, protected forest or
        any area recorded as forest in the government records. Lands which are
        notified under section-4 of the Indian Forest Act would also come within
        the purview of the Forest Conservation Act 1980. The Supreme Court has
        also held that ‘forest’ as understood in the dictionary sense would also
        be included under ‘forest land’. The term ‘forest’ shall not be
        applicable to the plantation raised on private land except notified
        private forest. Tree falling in such plantation would however be
        governed by state acts and rules. The term ‘tree’ will have the same
        meaning as defined in section 2 of the Indian Forest Act 1927.
      </p>
      <h3>Salient Features of Forest Conservation Act 1980</h3>
      <p>
        In 1980 the Forest conservation Act was enacted for providing protection
        to the forests and to regulate the diversion of forestlands for
        non-forestry purposes. The major salient features of Forest Conservation
        Act, 1980 are following. Prior approval of the Central Government is
        essential for de-reservation of forest lands and/or diversion of forest
        lands for non-forestry purposes. The State Government has been empowered
        under this Act to use the forests only for forestry purposes. If at all
        it wants to use it in any other way, it has to take prior approval of
        central Government, after which it can pass orders for declaring some
        part of reserve forest for non-forest purposes (e.g. mining, agriculture
        etc.) or for clearing some naturally growing trees and replacing them by
        economically important trees (reforestation). It is a regulatory act and
        not prohibitory. The provision was made to conserve all types of
        forests. Such as Reserved Forests which are under the direct supervision
        of the government and no public entry is allowed for collection of
        timber or grazing of cattle. Then next is Protected Forest which are
        looked after by the government but the local people are allowed to
        collect fuel wood/timber and graze their cattle without causing serious
        damage to the forests. Then Village Forests which is assigned to a
        village community are called as village forests. And the last one is
        Private Protected Forests which refers to protected areas inside India
        whose land rights are owned by an individual or a
        corporation/organization. The Forest Conservation Act is an interface
        between conservation and development. Any illegal non-forest activity
        within a forest area can be stopped immediately under this Act. Some
        non-forest activity like construction works, pipelines for water supply,
        check posts, wireless communications etc were exempted. It permits
        sensible and regulated use of forestland for non-forestry purposes.
        During 1950-80, the rate of diversion of forestlands for non-forestry
        purposes was 1.5 lakh hectares per annum. After enactment of the Forrest
        Conservation Act 1980, the rate came down to about 35 thousand hectares
        per annum. At the time granting approval under the Forest Conservation
        Act following conditions are insists upon such as compensatory
        afforestation, treatment of catchment area, reclamation of mining area
        in phases, provisioning of safety zone area, rehabilitation of project
        affected families and plan for wildlife management etc. The Act provides
        for the constitution of advisory committee to advise the Government with
        regard to the grant of approved by the Central Government (Section. 2)
        or any other matter connected with conservation of forests which may be
        referred to it by the Central Government (Section. 3). On violation of
        the provision of Section 2, the offender shall be punishable with
        imprisonment for a period extending to 15 days (Section. 3-A). Any
        government department or any authority deemed to be guilty of the
        offence shall be liable to be proceeded against and punished
        accordingly. The amendment of 1988 shattered all the expectations of
        tribal communities and many voluntary agencies placed all the forest
        land under the jurisdiction of the forest department. For the purpose of
        section 2 of the Act, non-forest purpose means the breaking up or
        clearing of any forest land or portion thereof for: (a) The cultivation
        of tea, coffee, spices, rubber, palms, oil-bearing plant, horticulture
        crops or medicinal plants. (b) Any purpose other than reforestation, but
        does not include any work relating to ancillary conservation,
        development and management of forest and wildlife, namely, the
        establishment of check posts, fire-lines, wireless communication and
        construction of fencing, bridges and culverts, dams, waterholes, trench
        marks, boundary marks, pipelines or other like purposes.
      </p>
      <h3>Amendments in the Forest Conservation Act 1980</h3>
      <p>
        The amendment which took place in 1988 emphasised upon that forest
        departments are not allowed to assign and forest land by way of lease or
        otherwise to any private person or non-government body for
        reforestation. Clearance of any forest land of naturally grown trees for
        the purpose of afforestation is also not allowed. A period of fifteen
        days imprisonment punishment has to be given if any one contravenes this
        law. Then the Act of 1980 again got amended in 1988 and has following
        sections such as extent and commencement, restriction on the
        conservation of forests of use of forest land for non-forest purpose,
        constitution of advisory committee. A sympathetic shift towards issue
        concerning tribals was observed when the 1988 forest policy incorporated
        the clauses to protect the forest dwellers’ rights which ultimately
        resulted in the declaration by the Government of India of the September
        18, 1990 guidelines to regularise encroachments and settling disputes on
        forests lands. But in the midst of changing policies, legislation and
        Acts as described above the sufferings of the tribals continued. A ray
        of hope dawned on the lives of the tribals only when the then government
        at the Centre made a radical departure from what was known as an
        approach of ‘forest bureaucracy’ and enacted The Scheduled Tribes and
        Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act,
        2006. Thus, came into existence the Forests Rights Act (FRA) (as it is
        popularly known) and became a reality amid serious debates and
        resentment from the conservationists, environmentalists and other
        stakeholders including the Ministry of Environment and Forests. Through
        this Act, the forest-dependent communities gained eligibility to claim
        community rights and individual rights on the forestlands under their
        occupation for cultivation. Currently, the FRA is in implementation and
        it has completed a decade of its existence since its legislation in
        December 2006. Yet, the success in meting out justice to tribals appears
        to be distant dream. In fact, a number of reports, academic studies and
        government statistics on the disposal of claims made by the tribals and
        other forest dwellers, and the proportion of rejections suggest a
        discouraging scenario.
      </p>
      <h3>Drawbacks of the Forest Conservation Act 1980</h3>
      <p>
        This act transfers the power from state to centre for the conversion of
        reserve forest land to non-forest areas. Tribals are forced to involve
        in criminal activities like smuggling, killing etc when they are stopped
        from taking resources from forest resources. This law is more interested
        in protecting the forest ecosystem than the tribal people. Thus the
        power has been centralized at the top. The Act has failed to attract
        public support because it has infringed upon the human rights of the
        poor native people. They argue that the law is concerned in protecting
        the trees, birds and animals, but it is treating the poor people as
        marginal. Very poor community participation in the Act remains one of
        the major drawbacks which affect proper execution of the Act. ] This law
        does not acknowledge the knowledge of tribal communities towards forests
        resources. Thus in its perspective just conservation is important, the
        rights of the tribals residing in and on the fringes of it are also
        equally vital for living a quality and dignified life. It is an
        established fact that tribals or indigenous people inhabited,
        cultivated, grazed their cattle and made a living out of forest
        resources freely without any restrictions until the advent of the
        colonial rule, because, by the start of the 19th century, vast tracts of
        forestland were already under the control of the British regime.
        Thereafter it was all about hardships, exploitation and struggle for the
        tribals as they were declared illegal or encroachers in their own lands.
        The resentment and rebellion by tribals occurred across the country at
        different times; these were put down by the colonial authorities.
      </p>
      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        In conclusion the forest should be looked upon as a source of revenue.
        Forests are renewable natural sources. These are national assets to be
        protected and enhanced for the well being of the people and Nation.
        Individuals as well as governments can do their part in protecting the
        forests of the world. Knowledge about the importance of forest needs to
        be spread so that people become aware of the danger to everyone and
        everything on the earth by deforestation. People’s participation in the
        conservation of forests is of vital importance. So everyone should get
        involved in this national task. If we do not start and act now, it might
        get too late for the cause of conservation of forests.
