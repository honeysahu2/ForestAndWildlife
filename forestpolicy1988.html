      <h2>National Forest Policy, 1988</h2>
      <h3>An overview of how Indian forestry became conservation-centric</h3>
      <p>
        n the 35 years after India’s National Forest Policy 1952, the world
        changed. Governments became more sensitive to environmental
        exploitation, ecological degradation, and our responsibility towards
        life on Earth. And so, we had the Ramsar Convention (1972), the UN
        Conference on Human Development (1972), the MARPOL convention (1973) and
        CITES (1973). Within India, a slew of legislation focused on improving
        environmental quality. The Indian Parliament passed the Wildlife
        Protection Act 1972, Water Act in 1974, Air Act in 1981, the Forest
        Conservation Act in 1980 and the Environment Protection Act in 1986. The
        steady shift towards conservation, preservation, and protection
        translated itself into the forest management policy as well. Thus, the
        National Forest Policy was revised in 1988 with several changes in how
        forest management was to be approached. The preamble of the National
        Forest Policy 1988 captures this shift in priorities. It recognizes that
        forest resources have severely depleted because of “relentless pressures
        arising from ever-increasing demand for fuelwood, fodder and timber;
        inadequacy of protection measures; diversion of forest lands to
        non-forest uses without ensuring compensatory afforestation and
        essential environmental safeguards; and the tendency to look upon
        forests as revenue-earning resource.”
      </p>
      <h3>Key highlights of the National Forest Policy 1988:</h3>
      <p>
        1. Shift towards conservation based forestry 2. Renewed focus on
        increasing forest cover, encouraging social and farm forestry. 3.
        Greater recognition for the rights of forest communities and their role
        in forest conservation. 4. Stress on finding alternatives to wood for
        various industries. 5. Stringent measures to prevent forest exploitation
        and land conversation by industries.
      </p>
      <h3>
        The principal aim and basic objectives of the National Forest Policy
        1988
      </h3>
      <p>
        The principal aim of the policy is to encourage environmental
        sustainability and ecological balance. Deriving economic benefits from
        nature must be subordinated to this aim. The principal aim is supported
        by several objectives: 1.Maintenance and restoration of ecological
        balance 2.Conserving the natural heritage of the country by preserving
        the remaining natural forests with the vast variety of flora and fauna
        3.Soil and water conservation to mitigate floods, droughts and reduce
        siltation in reservoirs (the last was turning out to be a problem
        because India had built several dams in the first 30 years of
        independence) 4.Checking extension of sand dunes 5.Increase forest cover
        6.Increasing productivity and efficiency of resource utilization, to
        meet both local population needs and national needs
      </p>
      <h3>Essentials of forest management</h3>
      <p>
        The National Forest Policy 1988 outlines the essential ingredients for
        good forest management under the new priorities.First, it stresses that
        forest management should protect and enhance forest and forest lands.
        This includes the conservation of biodiversity by strengthening
        protected areas. Second, it recognizes that forest fringe areas and
        forest communities depend on the forests for fuelwood, food, fodder and
        other minor forest produce for their livelihoods. Therefore, forest
        management should look to address these forest services as a priority,
        so that the forest resources are not overexploited by the dependent
        communities. Finally, it stresses that while increasing forest resources
        and protecting existing forest lands is the primary aim of forest
        management, it should not be done by converting productive agricultural
        land into forests.
      </p>
      <h3>Afforestation, social forestry and farm forestry</h3>
      <p>
        Rapidly depleting forest resources put a renewed focus on increasing
        forest cover. The policy reiterated the earlier target over covering 1/3
        of the total land mass with forests and identified several avenues for
        afforestation. Afforestation was encouraged along roadsides, railway
        lines and canals and other unutilized land by both private and public
        entities. The policy encouraged social forestry on unused community
        land. The government was to provide the technical assistance and initial
        financial assistance to set up such programmes, and the benefits
        generated from social forestry were to go to the community through the
        panchayats. The policy also speaks about farm forestry. Individual
        farmers were encouraged to grow tree crops for industrial and fodder
        use. Degraded, unused and unowned land were to be allocated to landless
        individuals through “tree-pattas”.
      </p>
      <h3>Greater recognition for tribal rights</h3>
      <p>
        The policy recognizes that the rights of tribal groups and other poor
        living in and around the forests should be protected. These groups must
        be given preferential and convenient access to the forest produce (food,
        fodder, minor produce). However, it maintains that such access to forest
        resources must be within the defined carrying capacity of forests. It
        encourages two approaches when the carrying capacity is too low to meet
        the local demands: 1.increasing the carrying capacity through investment
        and silvicultural research and 2.introducing social forestry outside the
        forests. As a marked deviation from the earlier policy, the National
        Forest Policy 1988 encouraged involving tribal groups in the protection,
        regeneration and development of forests through tribal cooperatives and
        other government institutions. Tribal groups know the forest intimately,
        and their knowledge would not only enhance the forests quickly but also
        provide employment opportunities for these groups. This recognition
        allowed forest villages to gain a better foothold in the country, and
        their development became as important as revenue villages.
      </p>
      <h3>Finding alternatives to forest produce</h3>
      <p>
        While the 1952 policy placed economic and national interests above all,
        permitting the use of forest products to these ends, the 1988 policy
        recognized that this led to overexploitation of forest resources.
        Therefore, it highlights that to relieve pressure on forest resources
        for railway sleepers, construction industry (particularly in the
        public-sector), furniture and panelling, mine-pit props, paper and paper
        board etc., “substitution of wood needs to be taken recourse to”. In the
        same vein, it draws attention to fuelwood use by exploring substitutes
        like LPG and solar energy. Fuel-efficient chulhas are also encouraged as
        a way to conserve forest resources. The policy also takes a stance on
        relieving pressures from shifting cultivation, a widespread practice in
        the North-East. It strictly discourages this form of cultivation, as it
        is believed to accelerate land degradation. This is, in fact, a view
        perpetuated from colonial times. The latest research suggests that it
        may not be the case.
      </p>
      <h3>Forests and industries: A new relationship</h3>
      <p>
        The National Forest Policy 1988 takes a stringent approach to the
        forest-industry relationship. Diversion of forest land “should be
        subjected to the most careful examination by specialists from the
        standpoint of social and environmental costs and benefits”, it reads.
        When diversion is considered absolutely critical, the policy stresses
        that projects acquiring and converting forest lands must provide for
        regeneration and compensatory afforestation “in their investment
        budget”. The policy singles out mining and quarrying activities. These
        projects must include restoration plan, or a clearly defined mine
        management plan appraised from an environmental angle. No mining lease
        is to be granted without an approved plan.Several new clauses were added
        also added to how forest-based industries (industries that use depend on
        forests for raw materials) function. The policy revoked their easy
        access to existing forest resources, stating that “the practice of
        supply of forest produce to industry at concessional rates should
        cease”. Such industries should explore alternative raw materials or
        should raise forest-based raw materials for their activities themselves,
        either by directly acquiring land or by establishing a partnership with
        local communities/individuals who can grow the raw materials. These
        industries must also provide employment to local people.Forest-based
        industries, except at the cottage/community level, will be heavily
        scrutinized before approval, the policy reads. No forest-based industry
        must sacrifice the local needs. Both these statements gave greater
        recognition to forest-dependent people.
      </p>
      <h3>Key research areas</h3>
      <p>
        With new priorities, forest managers needed new ways to maintain/improve
        forest productivity while conserving it. The National Forest Policy 1988
        highlights some key research areas: increasing productivity of forest
        produce per unit area per unit time; restoration of wastelands,
        marshlands and minespoils; social forestry practices; forest products
        substitutes; and wildlife management. Encouragingly, the policy also
        recognized that the country has a very poor database for forest
        resources. Therefore, it mandated periodic surveying through modern
        techniques to better understand the status of forests and the progress
        of forest management activities. This policy has been the guiding
        document for forest management for the last 32 years. In this time, the
        world has, again, changed. Several experts are calling for a revision of
        the policy, and we may have a new version of the Forest Policy soon.
