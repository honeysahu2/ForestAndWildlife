      <h2>Project Tiger, 1973</h2>
      <h3>An overview</h3>
      <p>
        India is the world’s largest home for Royal Bengal Tigers. India hosts
        more than 70% of the total Tigers in the world. It is no surprise then
        that we are also prime targets for tiger hunters and poachers. To
        overcome this threat Project Tiger was launched in 1973 in India. Since
        the population of these beautiful big cats is spread across many states
        in India, the responsibility of protecting those falls upon the
        government. Project Tiger is the government’s response to this call of
        duty.
      </p>
      <h3>How Project Tiger was started in India?</h3>
      <p>
        Back in the early 19th century, There were about 40,000 Royal Bengal
        Tigers in India. Within seven decades, Royal Bengal Tiger’s population
        dwindled to a mere 1800. It was not only shocking and alarming but also
        a reflection of the neglect that was being heaped upon the National
        Animal of India. It was an undeniable failure. In light of the scathing
        criticism brought on by these stats, the government looked into the
        issue and initiated steps to revive the tiger population in the country.
        Project Tiger in India was launched on 1st April 1973 as a major
        wildlife conservation project in India. It was launched from the Jim
        Corbett National Park of Uttarakhand. The initiative is funded by the
        Union Govt. of India and administrated under the Ministry of
        Environment, Forests and Climate Change. National Tiger Conservation
        Authority (NTCA) is the immediate supervising agency.
      </p>
      <h3>Aim to start Tiger Project in India</h3>
      <p>
        The stated aims of Project Tiger were To identify factors causing a
        reduction in tiger habitats and mitigate them through suitable
        management practices. The damages already done to the habitat were to be
        corrected so that the natural ecosystem can be recovered to the extent
        possible. To maintain a viable tiger population for their economic,
        ecological, cultural, and aesthetic significance
      </p>
      <h3>When was Project Tiger launched?</h3>
      <p>
        Project Tiger was launched in the year 1973. It was one of the most
        important conservation efforts initiated to protect Tigers in India. It
        was the first of its kind of Project in India to maintain the population
        of Tigers in India and to protect them from Poaching and other threats.
      </p>
      <h3>History of Tiger Project in India</h3>
      <p>
        Initially, When Project Tiger was rolled out in 1973, nine tiger
        reserves encompassing an area of 9,115 sq km were identified to be
        brought under special protection. By the late 1980s the number of
        protected tiger reserves increases from 9 to 15. And a total area of
        24,700 sq. km of forested land was reserved for the Tigers. By 1984, the
        number of tigers present in Project Tiger reserves reached above 1100.
        In the next few years, more and more tiger habitats were added to the
        Project Tiger. By the year 1997 there were 23 tiger reserves stretched
        over an area of 33,000 sq. km were being protected under Project Tiger
        in India. However, even as the range of protected areas continued to
        expand, the number of tigers didn’t increase considerably.
      </p>
      <h3>Tiger Census (Counting of Tigers)</h3>
      <p>
        The first Tiger Census of 2006 projected 1,411 tigers were left in the
        country. Since the census methods used were technology-based, the
        results were more believable. The results estimated a total tiger
        population at 1,411 individuals ranging from 1,165 to 1,657 adult and
        sub-adult tigers. 2006 Census created a second round of stir and debate
        around tiger conservation. Protection efforts have increased manifold
        since then. Owing to the renewed sincerity to Tiger conservation, the
        number of tigers consistently increased in the next decade. 2014 Tiger
        Census-estimated 2,226 Bengal tigers in India and 2018 Tiger
        Census-estimated 2,967 Tigers. Karnataka was the state with the highest
        tiger population in 2014. The recorded tiger count in the state was 408
        as per the 2014 tiger census. But, in 2018 Tiger Census, The crown of
        the Tiger State of India is been taken away by Madhya Pradesh with 526
        Tigers, whereas Karnataka and Uttrakhand were second and third in
        position with 524 and 442 Tigers respectively. Whereas in 2022 Tiger
        Census, Madhya Pradesh retained the crown of Tiger State with 785 Bengal
        Tiger Population. The total Tiger Population as per the Tiger Census
        2022 is 3,682 Tigers, which was 24% more than the 2018 Census. Today,
        Project Tiger looks after 50 tiger reserves spread across 72,749 sq. km.
        of green cover in an effort to conserve the population of the Royal
        Bengal Tiger

      <h3>Project Tiger’s Management</h3>
      <p>
        NTCA administers Project Tiger completely. And for the same various
        conservation units have been established consisting of a field director
        and a group of technical people to assist. Various conservation units
        that have been formed to help Project Tiger in India are: Eastern Ghats
        Conservation Unit Western Ghats Conservation Unit Central India
        Conservation Unit North-East Conservation Unit Sariska Conservation Unit
        Kaziranga Conservation Unit Shivalik Terai Conservation Unit Sunderbans
        Conservation Unit
      </p>
      <h3>Core-Buffer Strategy in Project Tiger</h3>
      <p>
        For the sake of efficient management and tiger density-based
        administration, tiger reserves are created on the basis of a
        ‘core-buffer’ strategy. A particular expanse of land is identified and
        marked as the ‘core area of the reserve. These areas are kept free of
        all human activities. It usually has the legal status of National Park
        or Wildlife Sanctuary. No human activity is allowed inside the core
        area, including tourism. Even everyday tasks such as grazing and wood
        collection are banned. The buffer areas usually surround the core area
        and are comparatively less frequented by the resident wildlife. Hence,
        limited human interaction here will not harm their habitat. Hence, it is
        subjected to ‘conservation-oriented land use’. Certain everyday
        activities necessary for daily life and living of surrounding villages
        are allowed. The buffer area serves twin purposes. One, it serves as a
        habitat supplement to the spillover population of wild animals from the
        core area. Two, it becomes a livelihood source for surrounding villages
        and relieves their impact on the core zone. The plan of action for each
        tiger reserve is drawn upon the following key principles: Elimination of
        all human interference from the core area and careful rationalization of
        activities in the buffer area Limiting the habitat management practices
        to only repair activities for ecosystem damage Monitoring the floral and
        faunal changes overtime for research To counter poaching, wireless
        communication systems and outstation patrol camps have been deployed
        within the tiger reserves. Fire protection is ensured through preventive
        and control measures. Compensatory developmental works have improved
        water availability which in turn betters vegetation. Lush vegetation
        cover helps in increasing the tiger prey base. Village relocation is one
        of the significant steps as well as a hurdle to reserve management in
        core zones. While some villages relocate voluntarily, most others resist
        giving up their ancestral dwellings. The issue gets even more sensitive
        in the case of tribal communities. The Indian Government passed the
        Forest Rights Act in 2006 which recognized the right of some forest
        communities to their native forest area. Recognition of this right is
        bound to have a serious implication of tiger conservation efforts, the
        extent of which is yet to be determined.
      </p>
      <h3>The success of Project Tiger</h3>
      <p>
        India was facing a huge challenge in the conservation of Tiger, with
        only 1200 Tigers left in the wild, It was a great threat to these
        beautiful Big Cat. But a Great Thanks to NTCA to launch Project Tiger in
        1973. The tiger population now is around 3,000, which is still not
        healthy and stable, but thanks to Project Tiger. It's all because of
        efforts of NTCA and Tiger Project Team Royal Bengal Tigers population is
        still a point of concern, but at least it is increasing and more people
        are coming together to conserve Tigers, many people are now aware of the
        conservation measures and participating actively in wildlife
        conservation-related activities.

      <h3>Facts about Tigers in India</h3>
      <p>
        India hosts a total of 75% tiger population of the world The result of
        the last Tiger Census 2018 was declared on 29 July 2019. The total
        number of tigers in India is 2967 as per the latest 2018 Tiger Census
        report. India is the only country to host three prime members of Big
        Cats Family; Lion, Tiger, and Leopards India has more than 100 National
        Parks and 50 Tiger Reserves
