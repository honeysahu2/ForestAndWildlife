      <h2>Wildlife Protection Act, 1972</h2>
      <h3>An overview of the objectives, salient features and amendments</h3>
      <p>
        Soon after the Stockholm convention on Environment, the Indian
        government responded positively by passing an act for the protection of
        India’s wildlife (both terrestrial and aquatic) and their habitats. Ever
        visited a Wildlife Sanctuary or a National Park? Taken a safari to enjoy
        the animals in the wild? Well, all that was possible only after the
        enactment of this Act.
      </p>
      <h3>Why was this Act needed?</h3>
      <p>
        A previous law, called the Wild Birds and Animals Protection Act 1935,
        had become completely obsolete. The jurisdiction of forests and wildlife
        came under the State governments, and each state government had a
        different policy in dealing with this subject. Furthermore, due to
        uncentralized regulation, huge exploitation of forests as well as the
        wild animals was going on for various economic needs. The numbers of
        different wild species of animals, including the cheetah, tiger, black
        buck fell sharply, and so did the total forest cover of the country.The
        Act was enacted to check this rampant disregard for the animals and
        birds of the country.
      </p>
      <h3>Objectives</h3>
      <p>
        The underlying objective of this Act is to protect the animals and birds
        of the country.
      </p>
      <h3>Salient Features</h3>
      <p>
        1.The Act has 7 Chapters, 66 Sections and 6 Schedules as of today. 2.Any
        amendment to this act can be done on the recommendation of an expert
        committee, that has been put together by the Indian Board of Wildlife.
        The Act has been amended in 1982, 1986, 1991 and 1993. 3.The 6 Schedules
        of the Act specify the level of protection for different species.
        Schedule I and II are for endangered species, that deserve rigorous
        protection and the breach of these rules results in serious punishment.
        A famous case where this was applied was when Salman Khan was sentenced
        to 5 years in prison for hunting a black buck. Schedule III and IV is
        for species that are not endangered, but the protection and punishments
        are equally rigorous. Schedule V delineates the animal species that can
        be hunted, like deer or ducks, and the rules pertaining to their
        hunting. Schedule VI covers the protection and trade of medicinal plants
        as well as agricultural species of plants. 4.Chapter IV of this act
        spells out the rules for the different types of protected areas that
        will be marked out for the protection of wildlife. 5.Chapter V concerns
        with the trade and commerce involving wild animals, as well as
        prohibition of the hunting of trophy animals. It states that every wild
        animal is the property of the Indian Government. A license is maintained
        by the government for the regulation of hunting as well as possession of
        wildlife parts. 6.Chapter VI spells out the punishments for different
        offences.
      </p>
      <h3>Protected Areas</h3>
      <p>
        The Act talks about the setting up of three types of Protected Areas for
        the protection of wildlife. These are- Wildlife Sanctuaries: A state
        government can declare any area as a wildlife sanctuary if it feels that
        the area has the necessary ecological importance. The setting up of the
        sanctuary is then taken up by the concerned District Collector. This
        includes the resettlement of people, if required, and the land
        acquisition process. Once the sanctuary is functional, the Chief
        Wildlife Warden is the highest authority for the sanctuary. He/She can
        provide permits for people to enter and utilize the resources within the
        sanctuary. It is not strictly off-limits. National Parks: The state
        governments are again responsible for taking initiative in declaring a
        site as National Park. National Parks are more strictly regulated than
        Wildlife Sanctuaries, with absolutely no other activity taking place
        within it’s premises. The boundary of a National Park is fixed and
        clearly specified, unlike a sanctuary. If this boundary needs to be
        changed for any purpose, a motion has to be passed in favor of it in the
        Legislative Assembly of the state. Closed Areas: These are areas that
        are temporarily off limits for a particular duration of time.
        Oftentimes, this for regulation of hunting of animals. Zoos: Under
        Chapter IV-A, zoos have been recognized to help in ex-situ conservation,
        when protection in-situ is not possible or impractical.
      </p>
      <h3>Punishments for offenses</h3>
      <p>
        This has been described in Chapter VI of the Act. All offenses under
        this Act are considered non-bailable and cognizable; meaning no search
        warrant is required by the authority if they think a person/party is
        guilty of breaking any rules of this act, particularly the trade of
        animal parts. If a person is found guilty of breaching this Act (unless
        provisions are stated), it can lead to an imprisonment of a minimum of
        three years and a fine of minimum of 25,000 rupees. If a company commits
        a crime against this Act, all persons in-charge of the company/project
        in question, as well as the company itself, will be the liable party.
      </p>
      <h3>1991 Amendment</h3>
      <p>
        The Amendment in 1991 introduced many small changes into the original
        Act. The most significant change was the introduction of a Chapter
        titled “PROTECTION OF SPECIFIED PLANTS”. This Chapter prohibits the
        extraction and sale of “specified plants” (mainly medicinal) from
        reserve forests and other protected areas, except for education,
        scientific research, etc. with the permission of the Chief Wildlife
        Warden. License will be issued if private individuals or entities want
        to cultivate “specified plants”. The Amendment also introduces the
        “CENTRAL ZOO AUTHORITY”, explaining its constituting members, powers and
        functions. The Act jointly refers to national parks, wildlife
        sanctuaries and closed areas as “Protected Areas”.
      </p>
      <h3>2002 Amendment</h3>
      <p>
        Further, the Act sets up the National Board for Wild Life and State
        Board for Wild Life, describing its members, powers and functions.
      </p>
      <h3>2006 Amendment</h3>
      <p>
        An amendment to this Act was passed in 2006, known as Wildlife
        (Protection) Amendment Act, 2006. This amendment was introduced with a
        view to increase the protection of tigers by introducing a chapter
        called “NATIONAL TIGER CONSERVATION AUTHORITY”.This section describes
        the institutional set up of the Authority and defines the Tiger Reserve,
        which is “core or critical tiger habitat areas of National Parks and
        sanctuaries, where it has been established, on the basis of scientific
        and objective criteria, that such areas are required to be kept as
        inviolate for the purposes of tiger conservation, without affecting the
        rights of the Scheduled Tribes or such other forest dwellers, and
        notified as such by the State Government in consultation with an Expert
        Committee constituted for the purpose.“The Amendment also introduces a
        Chapter on “TIGER AND OTHER ENDANGERED SPECIES CRIME CONTROL BUREAU”.
        This Bureau will be called the Wildlife Crime Control Bureau and has
        powers to set up infrastructure to monitor activities in Tiger Reserves,
        apprehend violations of national and international laws and treaties and
        even prescribe punishment. This was a landmark Act in the environmental
        movement of India. It was soon after this that various other legislation
        like Water Act, Air Act and Environment Protection Act came into force.
