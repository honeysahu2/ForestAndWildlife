      <h2>National Forest Policy, 1952</h2>
      <h3>
        An overview of Independent India’s first approach to forest management
      </h3>
      <p>
        While the British ruled India, forests were managed for one clear
        purpose: timber (for the railways in the domestic and for exports).
        Forestry was also considered secondary to agriculture; this led to
        massive expansion of agricultural land at the expense of forest land,
        creating several physical problems in the country. Independent India had
        different goals and priorities from forests. First, she needed to
        develop her economy quickly. Second, new research at the time also
        highlighted the role forest plays in protecting national and community
        interests by checking land degradation. The National Forest Policy of
        1952 was formulated by keeping these two priorities at the
        forefront.(Currently, India follows the National Forest Policy 1988 as
        the guiding document for forest management in India.)
      </p>
      <h3>Key highlights of the National Forest Policy 1952:</h3>
      <p>
        1. A holistic but utilitarian approach to forest management as India
        became independent and needed to grow its economy. 2. Introduced a
        functional classification of forests in India, but did not replace the
        forest classification from the Indian Forests Act, 1927. 3. A top-down
        approach to forest management 4. Proposed to increase forest cover to
        1/3 of the total Indian landmass 5. Introduction of the working plan as
        the guiding forest management document at state and local levels
      </p>
      <h3>Six needs that the National Forest Policy 1952 sought to address…</h3>
      <p>
        1. Improve land use management, where land was used for the purpose it
        is most ideal for, allowing it to sustain for long periods. 2. Arrest
        soil erosion and land degradation in mountainous terrain, treeless
        terrain, coastal plains and the Rajasthan (then called Rajputana)
        desert. 3. Improve microclimate through growing and maintaining trees,
        particularly in areas outside those classified as forests 4. Meet the
        increasing demand for grazing land, wood for small agricultural
        supplements and fuelwood. Fuelwood generation was seen as an important
        activity, as it would then free cow dung to be used as manure in food
        production. 5. Enhance timber production for defense, communication and
        industry 6. Maximize annual revenue from forests to ensure that the 5
        needs mentioned above can be met “in perpetuity” The needs highlight the
        approach of the government at that time: forest management was a
        utilitarian exercise. It had to contribute to the economy directly or
        indirectly. Unlike today, when forest management is focused on
        conservation of forest resources, forest practices then stressed on
        deriving the maximum use out of forests (sometimes at the expense of
        local communities, see below for more on this). Where conservation was
        highlighted, it was done so to avoid potential economic losses that the
        lack of forests may bring because of soil erosion or land degradation,
        or to ensure that economic benefits from forests can be sustained.
      </p>
      <h3>A functional classification of forests…</h3>
      <p>
        The National Forest Policy 1952 classified forests functionally into
        four categories: 1. Protection forests: forests that were conserved for
        physical and climatic considerations. The Policy elaborates that forests
        in sensitive areas like slopes, river valleys and coastal lands will
        provide a protective influence on soil, water and climatic
        characteristics of the locality, and that these needs far outweigh the
        restrictions from the use of these forests. However, the Policy also
        states that “wherever possible”, the scientific management of protection
        forests must include the production and exploitation of timber “within
        limits of safety”. 2. National forests: the forests that need to be
        maintained and managed for defence, communication, industry and other
        matters of public importance. The Policy highlights this to be a vital
        approach to ensure self-sufficiency of the country. 3. Village forests:
        also called “fuel forests”, these forests are expected to serve the
        needs of the local communities living in and around forest areas.
        Village forest management should aim at meeting the present as well as
        the future needs of the local population. More on this below. 4.
        Treelands: today, they are called “trees outside forests” or TOF. The
        Policy highlights that such treelands are important for the overall
        health of the country and its citizens. Enhancing tree cover outside
        forests through treelands was approached indirectly, through events like
        the Van Mahotsav, by educating the population to be “tree conscious” and
        by encouraging farmers to plant trees within their farmland, in
        community land and along roadsides.
      </p>
      <h3>A top-down approach to forest management…</h3>
      <p>
        The need to manage forests for national interests of industry and
        self-sufficiency translated into a top-down approach to forest
        management in the country. This is clearly visible where the Policy
        talks about village forest management and rights. It highlights the need
        to ensure that removal of forest produce beyond its annual growth should
        not be permitted. This “renders the entrusting of the management of
        village forests to panchayats, without safeguards, a hazardous
        undertaking”. While the Policy encourages involving local panchayats in
        village forest management, this must not “be at the cost of economy and
        efficiency”. In other areas in the Policy, it highlights that village
        forests must be managed scientifically, however “irksome” this may be to
        local communities. This approach systematically regulated (and sometimes
        eliminated) forest rights for the communities living within forests and
        in fringe areas. It took a long time for this situation to be reverse.
        In this same vein, grazing was seen as a largely destructive force
        within forest areas, “incompatible with scientific forestry”. The Policy
        highlighted several methods to control grazing: encouraging rotational
        grazing, banning goats in forests (because it is a browser, damaging
        saplings), and by levying a fee for grazing rights within forests.
        Interestingly, the Policy also encourages action to create a behavior
        change by stating: The notion that a farmer’s wealth must be reckoned in
        terms of the number of cattle he owns, regardless of quality is one of
        the causes of India’s uneconomical cattle wealth and must be combated.
      </p>
      <h3>“One-third of the total land area under forests”</h3>
      <p>
        The target to cover one-third, or 33%, of the total land area under
        forests was articulated in the National Forest Policy 1952. The India
        State of Forests Report 2019 reveals that India’s forest cover is 24.56%
        of the total land mass. We are yet to meet this target, after 65 years.
        The Policy also provides general targets for different terrains. In hill
        and mountain slopes where the threat of soil erosion is high, forest
        cover must be two-thirds of the available land. In plains, where land
        use pressures are greater, the Policy set a modest target of 20%.
        Recognizing competing (and more beneficial) land uses like agriculture,
        industry and urban development in plains, the Policy also stressed that
        most of the tree cover may be concentrated in river banks and “other
        places not suitable for agriculture”.
      </p>
      <h3>Forest management for sustainable yields…</h3>
      <p>
        The Policy stresses that while forests must be exploited for national
        gains, removal of forest resources must not exceed annual growth in
        forests. Thus, the Policy stresses that each forest—public or
        private—must develop a forest working plan to ensure sound forest
        management and sustainable and consistent income from forests.
      </p>
      <h3>Forestry education and research</h3>
      <p>
        The Policy stresses the need for specialized training of forest
        administration and field staff. Specialized research into the use of
        forest products is also championed, which was to be led by the Forest
        Research Institute. In line with the tone of the entire Policy, it
        recognizes that connections between research and commercial interests
        need to be strengthened to gain the most economic benefit from efficient
        use of forest resources.
