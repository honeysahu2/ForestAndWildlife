      <h2>Biodiversity Act, 2002</h2>
      <h3>An overview</h3>
      <p>
        The Biological Diversity Act, 2002 was born out of India’s attempt to
        realise the objectives enshrined in the United Nations Convention on
        Biological Diversity (CBD) 1992 which recognizes the sovereign rights of
        states to use their own Biological Resources. Biodiversity: The
        biodiversity means the variability among living organisms from all
        sources and the ecological complexes of which they are part and includes
        diversity within species or between species and of ecosystems Biological
        Resources: The biological resources means plants, animals and
        micro-organisms or parts thereof, their genetic material and by-products
        (excluding value added products) with actual or potential use or value,
        but does not include human genetic material. The Biological Diversity
        Act, 2002 The act was enacted in 2002, it aims at the conservation of
        biological resources, managing its sustainable use and enabling fair and
        equitable sharing benefits arising out of the use and knowledge of
        biological resources with the local communities.
      </p>
      <h3>Salient Features of the Act</h3>
      <p>
        The Act prohibits the following activities without the prior approval
        from the National Biodiversity Authority: Any person or organisation
        (either based in India or not) obtaining any biological resource
        occurring in India for its research or commercial utilisation. The
        transfer of the results of any research relating to any biological
        resources occurring in, or obtained from, India. The claim of any
        intellectual property rights on any invention based on the research made
        on the biological resources obtained from India. The act envisaged a
        three-tier structure to regulate the access to biological resources: The
        National Biodiversity Authority (NBA) The State Biodiversity Boards
        (SBBs) The Biodiversity Management Committees (BMCs) (at local level)
        The Act provides these authorities with special funds and a separate
        budget in order to carry out any research project dealing with the
        biological natural resources of the country. It shall supervise any use
        of biological resources and the sustainable use of them and shall take
        control over the financial investments and their return and dispose of
        those capitals as correct. Under this act, the Central Government in
        consultation with the NBA: Shall notify threatened species and prohibit
        or regulate their collection, rehabilitation and conservation Designate
        institutions as repositories for different categories of biological
        resources The act stipulates all offences under it as cognizable and
        non-bailable. Any grievances related to the determination of benefit
        sharing or order of the National Biodiversity Authority or a State
        Biodiversity Board under this Act, shall be taken to the National Green
        Tribunal (NGT).
      </p>
      <h3>Exemptions from the Act</h3>
      <p>
        The Act excludes Indian biological resources that are normally traded as
        commodities. Such exemption holds only so far the biological resources
        are used as commodities and for no other purpose. The act also excludes
        traditional uses of Indian biological resources and associated knowledge
        and when they are used in collaborative research projects between Indian
        and foreign institutions with the approval of the central government.
        Uses by cultivators and breeds, e.g. farmers, livestock keepers and bee
        keepers and traditional healers e.g.vaids and hakims are also exempted.
        The National Biodiversity Authority The National Biodiversity Authority
        (NBA) was established in 2003 by the Central Government to implement
        India’s Biological Diversity Act (2002). It is a Statutory body that
        performs facilitative, regulatory and advisory functions for the
        Government of India on the issue of Conservation and sustainable use of
        biological resources. The NBA has its Headquarters in Chennai, Tamil
        Nadu, India.
      </p>

        biological resources and for fair and equitable benefit sharing in
        accordance with the Biological Diversity Act, 2002. Taking necessary
        measures to oppose the grant of intellectual property rights in any
        country outside India on any biological resource obtained from India or
        knowledge associated with such biological resources derived from India
        illegally. Advising the State Governments in the selection of areas of
        biodiversity importance to be notified as heritage sites and suggest
        measures for their management.
      </p>
      <h3>State Biodiversity Boards (SBBs)</h3>
      <p>
