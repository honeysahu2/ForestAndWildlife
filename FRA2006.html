      <h2>Forest Rights Act, 2006</h2>
      <p>
        The Forest Rights Act (FRA) of 2006, also known as the Scheduled Tribes
        and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights)
        Act, is a landmark legislation enacted by the Government of India. The
        primary objective of the act is to recognize and vest the forest rights
        and occupation in forest land in forest dwelling Scheduled Tribes (STs)
        and other traditional forest dwellers (OTFDs) who have been residing in
        forests for generations but whose rights have not been recorded. Here's
        a detailed explanation of the key provisions of the Forest Rights Act:
        Recognition of Forest Rights: The FRA recognizes the rights of
        forest-dwelling Scheduled Tribes (STs) and other traditional forest
        dwellers (OTFDs) over forest land and resources that they have been
        traditionally using for generations but whose rights have not been
        officially recorded. Types of Rights Recognized: Individual Rights:
        Rights such as ownership, access to collect, use, and dispose of minor
        forest produce, habitat rights for primitive tribal groups, and rights
        to use and/or protect customary boundaries of habitat areas. Community
        Rights: Rights over community forests and resources traditionally
        accessed by communities. Process of Recognition: Filing Claims: Forest
        dwellers can file claims for recognition of their rights with the Gram
        Sabha (village assembly) within the stipulated timeframe. Verification
        and Decision: Claims are verified and decided upon by the Gram Sabha and
        subsequently by the Sub-Divisional Level Committee (SDLC) and District
        Level Committee (DLC) based on prescribed procedures. Role of Gram
        Sabha: The Gram Sabha plays a crucial role in the implementation of the
        act by facilitating the process of filing and verification of claims,
        ensuring transparency, and safeguarding the interests of forest
        dwellers. Conservation Provisions: While recognizing the rights of
        forest dwellers, the act also contains provisions for the conservation
        and management of forests and wildlife, ensuring that the rights are not
        exercised in a manner detrimental to the conservation objectives.
        Protection from Eviction: Once the rights are recognized and vested,
        forest dwellers are protected from eviction or displacement from their
        traditional habitats. Ongoing Challenges: Despite the enactment of the
        FRA, there have been challenges in its effective implementation,
        including delays in the recognition of rights, inadequate awareness
        among forest dwellers, conflicts over overlapping claims, and resistance
        from forest bureaucracy and vested interests. Overall, the Forest Rights
        Act of 2006 represents a significant step towards recognizing and
        securing the rights of forest-dwelling communities, promoting social
        justice, and ensuring sustainable forest management in India.
